### Key Bindings

## These key bindings attempt to make nano more CUA-like within the limits
## of available actions and what it will let the user bind. We can't bind 
## to shift, unfortunately.

## All the typical CUA actions are listed in comments with their key binding;
## if the function is missing, we unbind that key.

unbind ^N all
