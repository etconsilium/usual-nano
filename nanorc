### Key Bindings

## These key bindings attempt to make nano more CUA-like within the limits
## of available actions and what it will let the user bind. We can't bind 
## to shift, unfortunately.

## All the typical CUA actions are listed in comments with their key binding;
## if the function is missing, we unbind that key.

## Files
# new
unbind ^N all
# open, assuming multibuffer is enabled
bind ^O insert main
# reload
unbind ^R all
unbind F5 all
# save
bind ^S writeout all
unbind F3 all
# next file, ^tab
# previous file, shift-^tab
# close
unbind ^W all
# close all/quit
bind ^Q exit all
unbind F2 all

# beginning of file/buffer, ^khome
# end of file/buffer, ^kend
# page up, ^kpup, default
unbind F7 all
# page down, ^kpdown, default
unbind F8 all
# beginning of line, home, default
# end of line, end, default
# back one word, ^left
# forward one word, ^right
# search forward
bind ^F whereis all
unbind F6 all
# repeat last search
#bind F3 searchagain search
#bind ^G searchagain search
# repeat last search backward

# cut
bind ^X cut all
unbind ^K all
unbind F9 all
# copy
#bind ^C copytext all
# paste
#bind ^V uncut all
#unbind ^U all
unbind F10 all
# undo
bind ^Z undo all
# redo
bind ^Y redo all
# select all, ^A
# help
bind F1 help all
unbind ^G main

## For want of a useable CUA key binding, using the Emacs one.
# Cancel
bind ^] cancel all
# change to next file
bind M-N nextbuf all
# change to previous file
bind M-P prevbuf all

## Emacs brain damage compensation
bind ^A home all
bind ^E end all

## Extra nano functions not covered in CUA

# goto a sepcific line
bind ^G gotoline main
bind M-W wordcount main
# Can't use ^M, it binds to enter/return!
bind M-M mark all

# Drop these so more useful things appear in help.
unbind ^T all
unbind F12 all
unbind F11 all
